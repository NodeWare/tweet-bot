###How to Use

Replace the `access_token`, `access_token_secret`, `consumer_key` and `consumer_key_secret` strings from your twitter app
in the `_modules/tweet-bot/index.js`.

Thats all, you can now have your own twitter stream, a #hashtag you want to track and
the bot will retweet the tweets from that #hashtag stream.
